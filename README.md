# Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition Homework Solutions
This repository contains my personal solutions for **Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition** (ECE 8527/5110/4527) taught by Professor Joseph Picone at Temple University.

## Homework Solutions Overview
Each homework solution is contained in its own directory following the naming convention `hw_xx` where "xx" is the homework number (e.g., `hw_01`, `hw_02`, etc.).
